## Using Processor ##

Use it as you would any other Paperclip processor. For example, in your model:

    class Document < ActiveRecord::Base

      has_attached_file :file,
                        :styles => {
                          :pdf => {
                            :format => "pdf",
                            :processors => [:docsplit_pdf]
                          }
                        }

    end


which will convert your document into pdf.

### Extract text ###

WARNING: This feature is in alpha.

    class Document < ActiveRecord::Base

      has_attached_file :file,
                        :styles => {
                          :text => {
                            :processors => [:docsplit_text],
                            :full_text_column => :file_full_text
                          }
                        }

    end

will extract the text from the file uploaded, and desposit the full text of the file into the column 'file_full_text'.

### Extract metadata and thumbnail ###
